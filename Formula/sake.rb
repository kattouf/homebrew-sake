        Swift is not installed. Please install Swift to use this tool.
        The recommended way is to install it via Homebrew:
          brew install swift
        Alternatively, you can download it from the official website:
          https://swift.org/download#releases

        After installation, ensure that the Swift runtime libraries are available by setting:
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(swift -print-target-info | jq -r ".paths.runtimeLibraryPaths[]"):$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

        To make this permanent, add the above command to your shell configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc).
